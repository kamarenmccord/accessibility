    <div>
        <h4>Span or Button</h4>
        <p>When Developers use Span or Li tags in place of buttons it prevents screen readers from reading the tags for what they are intended. Whats more? You cannot tab to a span or li tag and thus those who do not have mice cannot click on these "onClick" spans. This unknowingly can create an unfair barrer for those with disabilities.</p>

export default Buttons
