            <p>When we first learn html stuctures we learn that all html documents contain a Head and a Body then the body contains a Header, Main, and a Footer. Then we learn a framework. What happens? everything becomes a div. Div here Div there Div everywhere! Div Div Div... Enough already. One of the most sure ways we can ensure accessibility is by taking a little extra time to use the correct HTML element for the job.</p>
