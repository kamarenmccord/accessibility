const Colors = () => {

        <div>
            <h4>Colors (gray on gray)</h4>
            <p>When we first start using colors we use all types of crazy colors. Edventually we learn that gray on gray... well its amazing and clean. Unforuntaly gray on gray can be hard to see if you have a hard time seeing in general. I'm not refering to those who cannot see here but rather those who wear glasses and those that are color blind. when choosing a color scheme try to use colors that are not so similar ex: <span className='colorblind'>this</span> may not work but <span className='colorFluid'>This</span> might.</p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Colors
